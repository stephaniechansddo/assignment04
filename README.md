# Book Titles Web Application Project

## Overview
This README file provides essential information about the book titles web application project and serves as a guide for developers joining the team. It includes project rules, history, setup instructions, and details to help you understand and contribute effectively to the project.

## Project Context
This project aims to create a platform for storing, managing, and retrieving book titles. The website will cater to users who want to maintain a personal library of book titles, track their reading history, and share recommendations.

### Key Features (Planned):
- **Book Title Management**: Users will be able to add, edit, and delete book titles. Each book entry will include details such as the title, author, genre, and a brief description.
- **Reading History**: Users will be able to log their reading activities, noting the start and finish dates for each book. This feature will help users track their reading progress over time.
- **Recommendations**: The platform will provide book recommendations based on user preferences and reading history.

## Project History
The book titles web application project began with the goal of simplifying the management of personal libraries. The project started as a simple tool for logging book titles and is evolving to include more comprehensive features for a better user experience.

### Milestones Achieved:
- **Initial Development**: The basic structure and an index page have been implemented.

### Future Directions:
As the project progresses, the team plans to:
- **Implement Core Features**: Develop functionalities for book title management, reading history tracking, and recommendations.
- **Enhance Data Analytics**: Implement analytics to provide insights into reading habits and preferences.
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Develop a mobile application to ensure accessibility and convenience for users on-the-go.

## Rules & Guidelines
- **Branching Strategy**: We follow a Git branching model with main, develop, feature, and hotfix branches. Detailed guidelines on branching and merging are provided in our Git workflow document.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must undergo a thorough peer review before merging into the develop branch. Reviews help maintain code quality, consistency, and knowledge sharing among team members.
- **Coding Standards**: We adhere to Java & Agile framework coding standards and best practices. Consistent code formatting and meaningful variable naming are expected to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Testing**: Each feature or bug fix must be accompanied by appropriate unit tests. Tests should cover critical functionalities to ensure new changes do not introduce regressions.
- **Documentation**: Documenting code, APIs, and architectural decisions is crucial. Use Javadoc for Java code and Markdown for project documentation to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.
